# PDF Compression

This python script is to compress a pdf. 

## Why you need a script?

Most of the online available pdf compress tools are not usable because they compress too much which causes very high loss of image qualit in that pdf.


You need to locate to the directory where you clone this repo. You can use command promt
or anaconda powershell. To locate to repo you just need to type in this command. I am using Anaconda PowerShell. Run Anaconda PowerShell as administrator then paste the following commands.

```ini
cd 'path to repo'
```

Use the following command to install dependencies. 
 
 ```ini
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

Now to run the program use the following command {It will work after I uplod the model.h5 file}

```ini
python Compress.py
```
